            I’m thrilled to embark on this exciting new journey. I’m eager to
            apply the skills I’ve learned so far and dive deeper into coding,
            problem-solving, and building dynamic, user-friendly websites.

        Biography<br />
        I am a 21 year old guy who always enjoyed coding at a young age. At
        first i chose to go towards the back-end route since i was curious about
        it, but after a while i found that it was not for me. I did enjoy the
        aspect of building and developing new things from scratch while i was
        studying and this made me realize that i wanted to use my creativity
        towards something that can help people push something out. That is why i
        chose to pursue Web Development/Web Design.
